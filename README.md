# CyberSquatter
A simple shell script used in conjunction with dnstwist to detect typo squatted domains.
More info regarding dnstwist can be found here: https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist

The script will read the domains provided within a text file one by one and output the results to csv.
The text file with all the domains needs to be named domains.txt and all domains names within the text file must be followed by a new line feed.
